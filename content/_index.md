description: 
  Hi, Jo here. 
  
  Welcome to my personal home on the web where you'll find links to my **formal teaching resources** as well as my own **informal ramblings** on what's interesting to me in this little field of **spatial data science** that is emerging. 
  
  You'll probably get a few additional posts on other interests in my life, including hiking and climbing around the **SF Bay Area**, particularly with my best bud, **Casper the Toller**.
