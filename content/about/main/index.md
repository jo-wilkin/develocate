  For those who don't know me, I am (and always will be) an avid Geographer, with a background in using Geo-Data Science 'for good'.
  
  My doctoral research focused on creating innovative geospatial datasets from Call Detail Records for humanitarian and sustainable development applications.
  
  Recently, I was a Lecturer in Social and Geographic Data Science at UCL, responsible for Undergraduate and Postgraduate course development and teaching as well as direct student supervision and mentorship. I spent time developing GIS-R teaching materials (that you can find in my Projects) using case studies focused on social, infrastructural and environmental issues.
  
  During my PhD, I created an award-winning [Geography Programming Bootcamp](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=181217df845045cc9ae1930005bf31b5), teaching undergraduates at the University of Southampton the basic principles of Python programming for data analysis within GIS-based research. Tenets of this course will be added to my Projects in due course.
  
  Prior to my PhD, I helped launch the [The Missing Maps Project](https://www.missingmaps.org) in the UK, leading large-scale training events and mapathons in the U.K.
